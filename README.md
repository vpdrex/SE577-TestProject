My name is Vinay Paratala. I've been working in the Software field for close to 16 years. In these years, I've held and worked in various roles including QA Engineer (manual and automation), Dev and QA manager and finally landed at the role of an Architect, which I've been doing for the past 6+ years. I am now an Architect for a domain in Comcast-CXT called Customer Engagement, which is responsible for building tools that allow our business and product partners to orchestrate and deliver all modes of unassisted experiences to the customers of Comcast

Through my career, I believe that my ability to understand how business and technology worked together helped me move from the role of a QA engineer to an architect while picking up the required skills on the job and with resources that were relevant to the work that I was doing at that point in time. While I've learned software architecture from experience in the industry, I haven't ever learned software engineering from an academic point of view, which is what I look forward to getting the most from this course. I believe that combining my experience in the industry along with the academic and theoretical view of software architecture will help me become a much better architect than I would be from just learning on the job
